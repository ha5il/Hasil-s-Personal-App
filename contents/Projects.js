Due to high voltage pulse in the transmission lines, the pilferer’s appliances drawing powers illegaly by way of tapping get impaired. This operation is transient (for 1-5 seconds) and during this time the supply of voltage for the normal consumers is kept suspended. However, in case of emergency, i.e., when the normal supply cannot be disturbed, the bypass mode is activated so that consumers continue to get un-interrupted power supply, and during this period the process of theft elimination is kept suspended. The actual working of this novel system has been demonstrated by simulating the process in Proteus autocad 8.6. The process thus developed is effective and reliable.'

This project is carried out with an objective to carry out performance analysis of some electrical devices like transformer, motor, generator in terms of its speed, temperature, voltage and current the parameters of respective device is recorded using dedicated sensors deployed across the project module. The project module includes the runtime java application along with Arduino interface environment which automatically detects the faults across the electrical devices and classifies it with the fault details. Based on the specifications of the devices, the pre set value for sensors is modified using Java and Arduino interface such that it automatically detects basic faults. Moreover, analysis of continuous data collected in periodic intervals from several motors helps in improvising them to the latest industrial demand.'
